# PCOS Pal

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS, is a chronic condition known as the most prevalent endocrine–metabolic disorder, affecting around 6–10% of reproductive-aged women across the world. The exact cause is unknown and there is no direct cure, but the symptoms can be treatable.

While there is not a specific test to diagnose PCOS, a diagnosis would commonly require at least 2 of the 3 following features: polycystic appearing ovaries, hyperandrogenism, and amenorrhea. An internal ultrasound is a common method of examination; however, they are not recommended for women younger than 20 years, thus making PCOS difficult to spot in early adulthood.

The reality is that many people go undiagnosed. In a study done by Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, researchers found that people who have PCOS commonly reported that they were unsatisfied with their overall diagnosis experience, including the information provided about the condition, the number of health professionals they had to see, and the wait time for diagnosis. PCOS affects physical health and mental well-being over the life span, and a delay in diagnosis can exacerbate these effects and even lead to more long-term health complications.

As someone who is experiencing the difficulties associated with PCOS, I wanted to come up with an application that could assist in the diagnosis process.
